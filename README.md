# SaMoTech Robotics

<!-- ![SaMoTech Team](https://samotechrobotics.com/images/team.jpg) -->

SaMoTech is a community-based robotics team that brings together talented and dedicated students from Santa Monica and the surrounding area. We are proud to have a diverse and passionate team with a range of backgrounds and interests. Check out our [website](https://samotechrobotics.weebly.com/) to learn more about us!

## Our Robot

Our robot is the result of months of hard work and collaboration by our team. We began the design process by brainstorming ideas and sketching out different concepts. We then built each individual part of the robot and carefully assembled them to create the final product. This allowed us to test and refine the design, making any necessary adjustments to ensure that our robot was functional and met the requirements of the competition.

## Our Code

One of the key features of our robot is its ability to autonomously drive and assist the drivers during competitions. The code is written is Java using advanced algorithms and sensor-collected data to navigate the field and perform tasks at a high consistency and accuracy. We try to keep our code well-documented and organized with a scalable structure that allows us to continue to elaborate on our advanced programs as the season and our robot progress.

## Sponsors

We would like to thank our sponsors goBilda, Panasonic Foundation, ZipRecruiter, and Rowe Neurology Institute for their support and generosity. Your contributions have made a significant impact on our team and have allowed us to pursue our interests in robotics and engineering. We appreciate your belief in us and the opportunities you have provided. Thank you for your ongoing support.

## Participation in FIRST

We are proud to participate in FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), a global organization that hosts robotics competitions for over 600,000 students across more than 100 countries. These competitions challenge teams to design, build, and program robots that can compete in head-to-head matches, with both autonomous and driver-operated options. The competitions culminate in regional and world championships. We specifically participate in FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) in which teams work together to design, build, and program robots that compete in an alliance format against other teams.
